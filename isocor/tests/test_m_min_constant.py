"""Test calculation of the minimal *mass* difference required to resolve two isotopic species
of a labeled chemical.

The minimal *mass* difference required to separate two isotopic species of a labeled chemical
correspond to the minimal difference of mz to distinguish two MS peaks at the operating resolution 
multiplied by the charge. The minimal mz difference is calculated at the operating 
resolution using 'resolution_formula' 'constant' at the mz of the labeled chemical.
