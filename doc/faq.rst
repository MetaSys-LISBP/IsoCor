Wait, I needed to correct something?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you don't fully understand why you should correct your MS isotopic data,
we invite you to have a look at `Midani et al. 2017 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2016.12.011>`_ excellent review.

..
  If you would like to know more about IsoCor correction process, please take the time to scroll through the :ref:`Theory` section.
  It will drive you through several correction examples, from typical to edge cases.

Finally, practical examples are provided in the :ref:`Tutorials`.


What are the alternatives to IsoCor?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You will find scripts for correction of HRMS data out there, but we wonâ€™t recommend any since,
to the best of our knowledge, they implement algorithms that partly fail for high-resolution datasets (see IsoCor v2 publication).

.. note:: If you would like your software to appear in this list, please get in touch with us.


How many peaks should I measure?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For a compound with :math:`n` atoms of the tracer element, you should measure :math:`n+1` peaks.


What mass fractions should I measure?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For a compound with :math:`n` atoms of the tracer element, you should measure
the :ref:`mass fractions <mass fractions>` corresponding to the compound having
incorporated :math:`0, 1, ..., n` isotopic tracers.


How to add a new metabolite/derivative into the database?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open the relevant database file with a rustic text editor (e.g. *Notepad++*) and add a new
row in your file following the format described in :ref:`Input data`.

Database files are created by default at the first run of isocor in '/user/isocordb'.
Additional metabolites and derivatives databases can also be defined, as described in :ref:`Input data`.

Take care not to modify the file format, nor its structure.
A typical error comes from Excel replacing '.' to ',' in floats.



What elemental formula should I declare into the database?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Obviously, errors in elemental formulas will result in erroneous
:ref:`isotopologue distributions <isotopologue distribution>`; thus special care must be taken
when defining these formulas. Details on the elemental formulas to be declared in IsoCor
can be found in :ref:`Tutorial section on formulas <formulas>`.


Should I tailor natural abundance of isotopes for my experiment?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The abundance of each isotope in
natural samples depends on their origin. For instance, marine organisms have been
reported to have slightly less :sup:`13`\ C than land plants [IUPAC2016]_.
Ideally, you should measure the exact abundance of each isotope present
in an unlabeled sample prior to the labeling experiment. However, most of the time such an
experiment would require too much resources for a negligible gain in precision, as we previously
found [Millard2014]_. The default values should be good enough for most users, unless you work
with strongly exotic material.


Where does the default values for natural abundance and mass come from?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From IUPAC [IUPAC2016]_.


Should I correct the tracer purity for my experiment?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes, if you know it. The purity of your tracer should be available from your
provider of labeled compound.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Isotopic purity and natural abundance of the tracer`


What is the default value for the tracer purity?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, we assume a perfect tracer purity.


Should I correct natural abundance of the tracer for my experiment?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes, you should correct for the presence of isotopes at natural abundance in unlabeled
positions of non-uniformally labeled nutrients.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Isotopic purity and natural abundance of the tracer`


How does IsoCor performs its corrections?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please have a look at the examples in the Tutorials section.
If you are looking for something more detailed, we invite you to review our source code from our `git repository <https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/IsoCor>`_.
Also, have a look at the logs in Verbose logs mode; all the intermediate results (correction vector used to construct the correction matrix, correction matrix, etc)
will allow you to reproduce the results with pen and paper.

How is computed the mean enrichment?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The mean isotopic enrichment of a metabolite refers to the mean content in isotopic tracer in the
metabolite, expressed as the relative fraction of total atoms of its element in the metabolite. This
information is particularly useful for the quantification of split ratios between two metabolic pathways
resulting in different content of tracer.
IsoCor calculates the mean enrichment (:math:`ME`) using the formula
:math:`ME = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}M_{i}.i}{n}`,
where :math:`M_{i}` is the proportion of isotopologues with :math:`i` :sup:`13`\ C atoms for a
metabolite containing :math:`n` carbon atoms.

I cannot start IsoCor graphical user interface, can you help me?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you  installed IsoCor following our standard procedure and that you are unable
to start IsoCor by opening a terminal and typing :samp:`isocor`, then there is indeed
something wrong. Do not panic, we are here to help!
Please follow this simple procedure:

1. The first step of the debugging process will be to get a *traceback*, i.e.
   a message telling us what is actually going wrong:

   * On Unix-based systems, you should already see it in the terminal you opened.
   * On Windows, you will have to open IsoCor from your Anaconda prompt with
     :samp:`python.exe -m isocor` to display the traceback.

2. Read the traceback and try to understand what is going wrong:

   * If it is related to your system or your Python installation, you will need to ask some
     help from your local system administrator or your IT department so they could
     guide you toward a clean installation. Tell them that you wanted "to use the graphical
     user interface of IsoCor, a Python 3.5 software" and what you did so far (installation),
     give them the traceback and a link toward the documentation. They should know what to do.
   * If you believe the problem is in IsoCor or that your local system administrator
     told you so, then you probably have found a bug! We would greatly appreciate
     if you could open a new issue on our `issue tracker  <https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/IsoCor/issues>`_.
     One of the developers will help you.

I would like a new feature.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We would be glad to improve IsoCor. Please `get in touch with us <https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/IsoCor/issues>`_ so we could discuss your problem.
